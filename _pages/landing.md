What is CloudForest?

CloudForest is a portable, easy-to-deploy, and reproducible computational platform for phylogenomics. The goal of CloudForest is to serve as a bridge that allows researchers to span all steps of a phylogenomic analysis, in order to explore and better understand variation and structure in sets of phylogenetic trees. While the tools available in CloudForest have many applications, some use cases include:

- Comparing the results of different phylogenomic analyses
- Exploring gene tree variation
- Identifying outlier genes
- Identifying species of hybrid origin
- Community phylogenetics and biogeography
- Sensitivity analyses (particularly for Bayesian inference)
